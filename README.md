# eCommerce Data Analysis and Sales Insights

## Project Summary
This project involves the comprehensive analysis of an eCommerce dataset to extract valuable insights, trends, and business intelligence. The dataset contains transactional data from an eCommerce platform, including information on customer behavior, product sales, and order details. By applying SQL queries, data manipulation, and visualization techniques, this project aims to provide meaningful business insights, identify sales trends, and support data-driven decision-making.

## Key Objectives
- **Data Exploration**: The project starts with exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure, identify data quality issues, and prepare it for analysis.
- - [Exploratory Queries (SQL)](/queries/exploratory_queries.sql)
- **Sales Trends Analysis**: SQL queries are applied to analyze total sales, monthly sales trends, and growth rates, providing insights into revenue patterns.
- - [Sales Trends (SQL)](/queries/sales_trend_queries.sql)
- **Customer Segmentation**: The dataset is used to segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
- - [RFM Segmentation (Python/pandas)](/pandas/RFM_calculation.py)
- - [RFM Segmentation (SQL)](/queries/customer_segmentation.sql)
- **Product Trends**: The project identifies trends in product sales like top-selling products and frequently out-of-stock items, aiding in inventory management.
